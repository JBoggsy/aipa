      "Okay, the user wants me to send a friendly greeting for a Monday morning, including an inspirational quote. Let me start by thinking about the tone. It should be upbeat and positive to set a good mood for the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the greeting. Maybe start with a cheerful \"Good morning!\" or \"Hello there!\" to sound friendly. Then, mention that it's the start of a new week, which is exciting. I should include something about looking forward to the week's adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the inspirational quote. It needs to be something motivational and relevant to the beginning of the week. Maybe something about challenges, growth, or opportunities. Let me think... \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" That's from Steve Jobs, right? It's about passion and dedication, which is good for motivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe another one. \"Each morning we have a choice: to step into the unknown with courage, or to step into the known with fear.\" That's from Maya Angelou. It's about facing challenges with courage, which is a good message for starting the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the quote fits well with the greeting. Let me check the structure. Start with a greeting, express enthusiasm for the week, include the quote, and end with an encouraging note. Maybe add a question to engage the user, like asking them to share their plans for the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user might appreciate a bit of humor or lightness. Maybe add a playful comment about coffee or a cup of tea. Something like, \"Hope you're sipping on some coffee or tea (or both) as you read this.\" That adds a personal touch and makes it feel more relatable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me put it all together. Start with a greeting, mention the new week, include the quote, add a personal touch about coffee, and end with an invitation to share plans. Make sure the language is friendly and positive. Check for any errors and ensure it flows naturally. Alright, that should cover it.\n",

As Maya Angelou once said, *\"Each morning we have a choice: to step into the unknown with courage, or to step into the known with fear.\"* Let’s choose courage today.  How’s your coffee/tea/energy levels looking?  What’s your plan for this week?  I’m cheering you on!  Here’s to a week of growth, joy, and doing things that make your heart sing.  Let’s make it great!\n"
