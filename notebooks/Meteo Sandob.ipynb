The wind is coming from 40 degrees, which is a bit to the northeast, and the wind speed is around 9.22 mph. The UV index is 3.68, so sun protection is recommended. Sunrise is at 6:47 AM, sunset at 5:25 PM. The pressure is 1029 hPa, which is normal.\n",

The wind is coming from 28 degrees, slightly different direction. The wind speed is 7.11 mph. The summary says \"partly cloudy with clear spells,\" so maybe some breaks in the clouds. The moon is in the first quarter, rising at 4:39 PM and setting at 5:38 AM. The UV index is 4.5, so sun protection is still needed but maybe less intense.\n",

Mention the temperature changes, wind direction and speed, and any notable weather events like moon phases. Also, note the transition from cloudy to clear spells. Make sure to highlight the highest temperature of the day, the minimum, and any significant wind changes. Keep it concise but informative, in a friendly and professional tone. Avoid technical jargon where possible. Check for any inconsistencies or missing data points. Let me put this all together in a clear, organized way.\n",
