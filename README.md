# AI Personal Assistant

A proper AI personal assistant and secretary that proactively manages your day, just like a real secretary would. AIPA is currently a work-in-progress, but will includeat least the following features:

Near-Term Features
------------------
* Proactive management: AIPA doesn't wait for you to reach out, because that defeates the point. Instead, it keeps itself up-to-date with what's going on in your life and pings you when needed.
* Persistent wake-up calls: You tell AIPA when you want to be up, and AIPA will automatically give you a "wake-up call." You can snooze this, of course, but AIPA knows how many times you've snoozed and will start to be more insistent. In it's wake-up call, AIPA gives you a run-down of the day, including the weather and your schedule.
* Secretarial knowledge: AIPA reads through your emails and texts and can access and manipulate your calendar. This allows it to collate all the knowledge about your day a good secretary would have, from important messages and emails to new tasks to social plans and even sales and news that might be interesting to you.
* Task handling: AIPA keeps track of all your tasks and goals, from work to play and everything in between. It provides you with helpful reminders when things are coming due or when you've neglected something for too long, and can keep you on task.
* Personalized: AIPA knows *you* the person, including your preferences and habits, and uses that knowledge to improve your life.
