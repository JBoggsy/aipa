Considering the current time, the user's location, and the user's context, identify and generate the
next task you need to complete in the immediate future (i.e., within the next five minutes). The
task should have a simple, clear, and achievable goal. Reply only with the task goal. Consider the
tools at your disposal. If the task can be accomplished with a single tool call, do so. When
deciding whether the task can be accomplished with a single tool call, consider whether you have the
information you need to make the tool call. If you do not, create a task instead.
