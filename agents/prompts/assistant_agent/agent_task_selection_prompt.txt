Considering the current time, the user's location, the user's context, and your current set of
tasks, select a single task to pursue. You should quickly evaluate each task goal in light of the
information you have, and then select the most pressing or important task. Reply with the number
corresponding to the task you select, and only reply with that number. Do not attempt to execute the
task. As a final reasoning check, ensure your reply is an integer.
